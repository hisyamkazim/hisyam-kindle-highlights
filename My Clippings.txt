It’s true that I might be able to get along well with people anywhere I go, but on the other hand, I’m constantly positioning myself as an outsider, and I can’t do more than interact with people. My mind is always calm. I don’t really have many memories of joy, even as a child. I don’t know why that is. I think it might be the effect of growing up in an emotionally distant home. I distanced myself from my parents at times, but I don’t think that was the only reason for it. I was probably just born like that. It’s just the kind of person I am.”

Very briefly, the Sophists thought that perceptions of what was right or wrong varied from one city-state to another, and from one generation to the next. So right and wrong was something that ‘flowed.’ This was totally unacceptable to Socrates. He believed in the existence of eternal and absolute rules for what was right or wrong. By using our common sense we can all arrive at these immutable norms, since human reason is in fact eternal and immutable.

Plato’s point is that we can never have true knowledge of anything that is in a constant state of change. We can only have opinions about things that belong to the world of the senses, tangible things. We can only have true knowledge of things that can be understood with our reason.

According to Plato, man is a dual creature. We have a body that ‘flows,’ is inseparably bound to the world of the senses, and is subject to the same fate as everything else in this world – a soap bubble, for example. All our senses are based in the body and are consequently unreliable. But we also have an immortal soul – and this soul is the realm of reason. And not being physical, the soul can survey the world of ideas.

Plato’s point was that the relationship between the darkness of the cave and the world beyond corresponds to the relationship between the forms of the natural world and the world of ideas. Not that he meant that the natural world is dark and dreary, but that it is dark and dreary in comparison with the clarity of ideas. A picture of a beautiful landscape is not dark and dreary either. But it is only a picture.

when you start to push people around, pressure them, or tell them what to do, you are threatening their hardwired need for control over their own lives, decisions, and actions. You’re getting in the way of their agency, the feeling that they are in control of themselves, their life, and their own thoughts and behaviors.

No one wants to feel pressured by their friends, family, or loved ones. What you want is unconditional love, acceptance, kindness, and compassion. You don’t want to be controlled; you want to feel deeply accepted for who you are, and where you are in your life.

you’re going to need to say Let Them a lot as you just focus on your own behavior and your attitude about it. It’s important to do this without the expectation that they will change. The reason why you have to give up your expectations is that if you do this expecting them to change, you’ll start to resent them when they don’t.

The conversation needs to be in person, without any alcohol involved or time pressure to finish quickly. Do not have the conversation in a random place, or when you only have 20 minutes on the phone.

This takes time, particularly with somebody that you love. So back off.

Tiadalah lagi dipikirkan jalan, cara, metode mana yang dipakai dan cara mana yang pendek dan jitu di antara beberapa cara. Yang dipikirkannya ialah lekas mendapat hasil, pendapatan yang betul, result. Sedangkan sebetulnya cara mendapatkan hasil itulah yang lebih penting dari pada hasil itu sendiri. Begitulah menurut pendapat penulis ini. Belakang hari di kelas sekolah yang lebih tinggi, penulis juga tiada begitu lagi memperhatikan hasil itu. Kalau sudah terlihat cara yang baik di antara dua atau lebih cara, maka sering penulis tiada lagi menyelesaikan persoalan itu sampai mendapatkan result dan tidak perdulikan beberapa soal yang bisa diselesaikan dengan hanya satu cara. Dengan begitu, banyak waktu terpelihara dan saya pikir kecerdasan berpikir bisa maju. Pada matematika yang tinggi, hasil itu memang tidak begitu penting lagi. Memang aljabar lebih abstrak dari aritmetika, lebih terpisah dari pada benda. Pada aritmetika saja kalau kita lihat 2 + 2 = 4, maka tiada lagi kita pikirkan bahwa dua itu cuma bilangannya, nomornya, salah satu dari sifat barang itu, bukan

Self-awareness gives us an ongoing sense of what we are feeling, why we have those emotional reactions, and how they shape our thoughts, feelings, and urges to act. Self-management lets us use that inner awareness to handle our emotions effectively: keep disturbing emotions from disrupting our activity, enhance positive feelings, bounce back from upset, keep our eye on our goals despite distraction, and be agile in our responses to changing challenges. These abilities help us stay in our optimal zone.

If you want to know the best person for a given job, don’t look at their IQ scores or at how well they did in school. Look, instead, at people who hold that position in your organization who perform in the top 10 percent—those with the highest competence—by whatever metric makes sense for their job. Compare them with people in the same role who are only average performers. Then do a systematic analysis to determine the abilities or competencies that you find in the stars that you don’t see in the average performers.

Our GMA, or “general mental ability,” another label for what we often think of as IQ or cognitive skills, has been shown over and over to be the best predictor of a student’s school grades, eventual income, and job success in general.6 But there’s one big exception to this rule: when life or work becomes an emotional roller coaster. Another exception: in our relationships, where empathy matters enormously. In these cases our self-management and interpersonal abilities make a huge difference.
